I love to solve problems with exceptional software. I want to make developers' lives better, easier, or just more awesome.

My interests revolve around content management, revision control, data systems and the like.

Graphs, content addressed storage, distributed storaage, all that stuff.  Whisper merkle dag and I'm in.
